Hi! I am a **Wei HU** and you can call me **Vincent**. 

I am a Distinguished Research Fellow at [School of Economics and Management](https://sem.tongji.edu.cn/semen/), [Tongji University](https://en.tongji.edu.cn/p/#/), where I specialize in the dynamic fields of Fintech, including crowdfunding, innovation management, intelligent marketing, non-fungible tokens, and social media. My methodological approach is rooted in applied econometrics supported by advanced data mining techniques, including natural language processing, machine learning/deep learning, and social network analysis.
