Welcome to my website!

I am a Distinguished Research Fellow in [School of Economics and Management](https://sem.tongji.edu.cn/semen/) at [Tongji University](https://en.tongji.edu.cn/p/#/). I obtained my Ph.D. from [Department of Information Systems](https://www.cb.cityu.edu.hk/is/), [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/), advised by Prof. [Xin LI](https://www.cb.cityu.edu.hk/staff/xinli24/) and Prof. [J. Leon ZHAO](https://myweb.cuhk.edu.cn/leonzhao).

My research focuses on Fintech, with particular emphasis on crowdfunding, innovation management, intelligent marketing, and financial social media. My work integrates applied econometrics, advanced data mining techniques, natural language processing, machine learning/deep learning, and social network analysis.
