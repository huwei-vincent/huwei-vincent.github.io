Welcome to my professional website!

I am a Distinguished Research Fellow in the [School of Economics and Management](https://sem.tongji.edu.cn/semen/) at [Tongji University](https://en.tongji.edu.cn/p/#/). I earned my Ph.D. from [Department of Information Systems](https://www.cb.cityu.edu.hk/is/) at [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/), where I was supervised by [Prof. Xin LI](https://www.cb.cityu.edu.hk/staff/xinli24/) and [Prof. J. Leon ZHAO](https://myweb.cuhk.edu.cn/leonzhao).

My primary research program lies at the intersection of Financial Technology (FinTech) and Information Systems. I investigate several key domains, including Crowdfunding Mechanisms, Innovation Management, Intelligent Marketing, and Financial Social Media. To address these complex phenomena, I employ a multi-disciplinary methodological framework. My research integrates applied econometrics for causal inference with advanced computational techniques, including Data Mining and Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning and Deep Learning, and Social Network Analysis (SNA).
